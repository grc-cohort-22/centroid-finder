## ImageSummaryApp
* Parse the information into 3 sepereate parts including image, color#hex, and threshold 
* First check if all the values above fit the parameters or throws an error.
* Takes the target color and turns it into a 24bit integer/ binarizing.
* Then we take the color and use this equation and return the value 
  * sqrt((r1 - r2)^2 + (g1 - g2)^2 + (b1 - b2)^2)
* Then we use the DistanceImageBinzarizer to make the image black and white 2d binarary array. Making each pixel 0 for black and 1 for white.
* Finally we use BinaryGroupFinder to see the location of all items/islands in the image and return the location.
