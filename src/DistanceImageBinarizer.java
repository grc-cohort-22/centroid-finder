    NOTES:
    java.awt.image.BufferedImage is a class that contains and provides getRGB and setRGB
    more on: https://docs.oracle.com/javame/config/cdc/opt-pkgs/api/agui/jsr209/java/awt/image/BufferedImage.html
        int getRGB(int x, int y) : getRGB returns the pixel colors at coordinates (x,y) as an integer.
        void setRGB(int x, int y, int rgb) : Sets the pixel at (x, y) to the specified ARGB integer value.
        int getHeight() : returns the height of the bufferedImage
        int getWidth() : returns the width of the bufferedImage

    there are two methods:
        one is to convert bufferedImage into binary array
        the other is to convert binary array into bufferedImage
    so first method converts colorful image into 2d array of 1's and 0's, then second method converts the 2d array into black and white image.

    - toBinaryArray would require getRGB (which returns an int), we take the int of each pixel and convert it into 1 or 0 in the array.
    - toBufferedImage would require setRGB (a void that sets pixel location (x,y) to a color),
        based on the param of 2d array of 1's and 0's, we create a new BufferedImage and set each pixel location corresponding with
        image array row and col to the either black or white.
    
    distanceFinder: is passed using EuclideanColorDistance, so we can call the method in there.
    targerColor: is another 24-bit hex RGB integer, i believe we call distanceFinder.distance(
        targetColor,
        getRGB from bufferedImage image in the first method
    )
    threshold: distanceFinder.distance will return an int, we compare int threshold with the return result.

    When creating a new image, you can use the below to start the instance:
        new BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);


    /**
     * Converts the given BufferedImage into a binary 2D array using color distance and a threshold.
     * Each entry in the returned array is either 0 or 1, representing a black or white pixel.
     * A pixel is white (1) if its Euclidean distance to the target color is less than the threshold.
     *
     * @param image the input RGB BufferedImage
     * @return a 2D binary array where 1 represents white and 0 represents black
